week4day5 - peewee and psycopg2

Database tools!

peewee lets you not have to write manual SQL statements
psycho is putting sql statements IN your python code.

something called "migrations" peewee does a data migration

so when you say "run the first migration" you're running a python file. It could also be a numbered sequal file.

just make sure whatever you do here, when you go to dpeloy it you can do the same thing.

ORM are good bc you can do a lot of stuff and screw up less. if you do it manually, you'll probably mess something up. Forces you into best practices.


Everytime you add a new key (like author) you need a new migration.

BACKWARDS migration
for if you mess up.

Whenever we do a migration in ORM, it is the equivalent of an ALTER TABLE or ALTER COLUMN in sql.

if you have already created you, this is how you reference it.
me = Author.select().where(Author.twitter =='pizzapanther').get()
