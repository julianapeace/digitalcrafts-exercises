SQL part two:
Advantages of nosql is that you have larger tables, therefore there is no cost of creating another "lookup". less relationships.

repeating your data is ok because nowdays storage is very cheap and quite fast with SSD. For web stuff, storage is not really an issue.

if you're building a node bot, there's limited space so you might prioritize space.

*********************
One to Many
*********************
When it's doing a join, it's attaching ID to ID and combining the data (which is like two queries). Even though we can join by any key, the Primary key is faster bc it's indexed.

Relationships make it fast. SQL > nosql

RIGHT/LEFT usually just tell me which table I start with
USU don't do a full join
Paul usually only do left joins and just switch the tables. Helps keep it straight in the head.

JOIN = LEFT INNER JOIN

OUTER JOIN will bring in the "outliers" that didn't match up. Prob get more data.

*********************
Many to Many
*********************
In this relationship, there is a third table that connects the two. Naming convention: Paul likes to simple combine both tables to name the third table.

*********************
DISTINCT AND SUBSELECTS
*********************
When you're doing a full outter join, many times you will get duplicate data, you'll likely use DISTINCT, to get just singlets.
