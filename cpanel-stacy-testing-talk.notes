Stacy

QA manager at Cpanel.doesn't do unit, uses E2E functional.

How to QA our work:
 cpanel is huge, 1/3 of server is on the internet. can actually bring down the internet if QA is bad.

creator of cpanel is still the most prolific coder.
 check port 2083 to see if it's on cpanel. //
 check port 2096 for the mail. //guess their pw and try to break it

 use linux and perl. perl is easy to learn, similar to C+ and python.
 verbal disclaimers: "as far as i can tell" "thats what i've been told"

 how to apply eng writer in tech. applied for a technical writer for the documentation writer.
 Integrating "IPV6", has rules on how things look. Stacy is trying to document a how-to.
 Going in to verify the input was like testing in QA. She started doing a test-fest with the team and the QA team.

 terrifying moment was looking at the CEO and told him it's broken, then he fixed it on the spot.
 broke a lot of code, joked that he didn't need her in his team, promoted to QA manager.
 Cpanel has opportunity to learn. Ask the job, 'do you allow workshops, do you allow us to grow and learn, '
 'rebasing' in git is terrifying, could break everything if you do it wrong.
 Cpanel Have career paths within QA. ask them about 'career growth, career paths.' don't only look at programmer/developer type positions.
 You will be: Growing, learning, and making more money. loosely interpret 'have a career path in mind.'

make sure today-you is making decisions for 5yrs-you.
each scrum team has it's own role, will develop each piece from the team.
QA on each team is the subject matter expert.
Other organizations will dev and throw it to QA.
In traditional ways, whatever the BA(business analyst) tells you will test it.
while we are building, think about testing. 'if this is not my code, how will i break it'

Stacy likes raspberry pi. She's very excited and passionate, and down to earth. desire to go to colorado, want to hike for days and days. loves dogs.
Stacy expects you to research the dress code, low down business casual like jeans and button tucked in.

QA in each team will perform E2E testing.
In scrum, everyone is supporting each other, no roles.

CULTURAL WORK TIPS:
----------------------
**** As a woman, whats the percentage of women. Don't work for a company less than 20% woman. Statistics have show that it's not a good work environment. when job hunting, ask about that. ******

Ask about the work chart, how many people you have under you.
Cpanel Likes it flat. she reports to a director and then to a ceo. Nick does a welcome dinner to every new member, makes effort to know your name and your face.

Think about PTO. 3months is good, 2 weeks means you cant even stay home for a plumber.

Ask how they handle work-life balance, are you expecting 40 hrs, are you expected to be available 24hrs around the clock? if so, how do you compensate that.
