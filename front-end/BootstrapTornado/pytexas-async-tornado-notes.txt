Building asyn apps with tornado - mongodb, mysql, and redis, s3
MONGODB:
  Motor: async interface with MongoDB (laternative to pyMongo)
    add async and await in front
    THATS ALL

REDIS:
  aioredis:

AWS S3:
  Boto 3: not asynchronous, but can be worked around. Aiobotocore, has partial support for some aws services, including S3.

  to do it, need to write a wrpaper class.

AsyncHTTPClient:
  use it when trying to access something without a library. Don't need to write a wrapper fnc. Says its pretty easy to use, like requests library.

Tornado has a Multi function. can pass in list of objects and run it all in parallel. if one of them returns, it'll come back as a list. if it raises, it gets bubbled up as default.
