# bootstraptornado
BootstrapTornado is my coding playground to build full stack web apps. There's a cool web scraper in here, a blog, tip calculator, and a weather app. All built with python and some cool libraries like BeautifulSoup. And I use some amazon services like S3 and Boto. (which has an evil password sniffer, I won't tell you where!)
