debugging notes
======================

  ##### NODE DEBUGGER ######
    1. node comes with a debugger built in. $ node debug main.js
    2. most likely want to set a break point. type in debugger; anywhere in the code. hit continue. the debugger will stop at that point and check the variables, see what it looks lile. $ repl will drop you into a shell at the point. any scope or context will be available, play around, see if it works. like a freeze time.
    3. debugging is important in javascript bc things don't actually break.

  ##### CHROME DEBUGGER ######
    4. chrome debugger. can select line of code and debugger will run through until that line.
    5. there's an event listener, e.g. will stop when mouse is clicked.
    6. CSS debugger. quite powerful, hardest CSS bugs are temporary states, can force hover/visited/focused/active states.
