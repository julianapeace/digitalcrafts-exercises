all browsers support local storage

go into console.:
Add Item:  localStorage.colorSetting = #800
Call Item: localStorage.colorSetting OR localstorage.getItem("colorSetting")
Remove item: localstorage.removeItem('colorSetting')
Used like a simple dictionary storage.
You use local storage for user name, colors
E.G. logged-in = true

temporary storage, use session storage.
more perm storage, use local storage.

storing complex data
RGB value
localStorage.color = JSON.stringify([255, 0, 0]);
localStorage.color = JSON.stringify({r: 255, g: 0, b: 0});
JSON.parse(localStorage.color)

It will live forever. If user doesn't go in to delete it. It can be cleared but paul says most users don't.

for contacts react app:
we might want to check local storage. restore it. load them up.
